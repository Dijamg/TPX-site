            The Phantom Phoenix Organization, also known as TPX, is a Discord community which focuses on video games. This Discord was founded by a few members but it has grown rapidly over the last year and now there's 69 of us. This community grows constantly because a lot of members like it and continue to invite their friends here. We play a variety of games, but the most popular games here at this moment are League of Legends, CS:GO and Valheim. Our community has hardcore gamers as well as casual players who just play once in while and prefer to do it with good company.
